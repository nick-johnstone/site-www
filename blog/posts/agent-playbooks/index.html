    <p>Agents fail when they improvise outside their lanes. The remedy is to treat each automation like a change request: define scope, approvals, telemetry, and rollback long before the first tool call runs. This playbook shows how to codify that discipline.</p>

    <h2>Design opinionated runbooks</h2>
    <p>Start from a crisp charter: <em>who</em> owns the agent, <em>which systems</em> it can touch, and <em>what success</em> looks like. Encode that in a YAML manifest that lives beside the code so PRs must update policy.</p>

    <pre><code>name: patch-tuesday-helper
owner: sre@needtoknowtech.com
systems:
  - jamf
  - crowdstrike
  - jira
approvals:
  required: 1
  roles:
    - security
logging:
  destination: http+json://logging.internal:8088/agents
  pii_filter: true
rollback:
  - type: script
    path: scripts/revert.sh
</code></pre>

    <h2>Add a human-in-the-loop layer</h2>
    <p>Ship a review screen that spells out the plan of record: which tasks will run, which accounts will be used, and what the post-conditions are. Agents that trigger outside working hours should default to <strong>pending</strong> until a reviewer clears them.</p>

    <div class="resource-grid">
      <div class="resource">
        <strong>Approvals</strong>
        <p>Require at least one approver for actions that touch production. For destructive changes, force multi-party sign-off.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="resource">
        <strong>Observation</strong>
        <p>Stream traces and token logs into an internal observer so you can replay decisions. Keep the data in your VPC.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="resource">
        <strong>Tooling budget</strong>
        <p>Limit number of tool calls and max duration per step to keep stuck agents from thrashing APIs.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Package and promote safely</h2>
    <p>Bundle the agent, its prompts, and the manifest into a versioned release. Promote between environments via the manifest so that logging, guardrails, and secrets remain consistent.</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Treat the manifest as the contract between product and operations. When a PR changes the contract, it signals a review for risk, observability, and rollback coverage.</div>

    <div class="video-placeholder">Add a short approval-flow walkthrough or dashboard demo here.</div>

    <h2>What to ship with every agent</h2>
    <div class="resource-grid">
      <div class="resource">
        <strong>Runbook card</strong>
        <p>Plain-language summary of scope, SLAs, and the audit trail location.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="resource">
        <strong>Test suite</strong>
        <p>Regression prompts, tool-call mocks, and abuse cases that run in CI before promotion.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="resource">
        <strong>Rollback hooks</strong>
        <p>Automation to undo or quarantine changes if the agent drifts or a reviewer rejects the run mid-flight.</p>
      </div>
